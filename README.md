Objective

To run certain tasks to automatically help identify picture cards of a game called Battles in Time, from the popular BBC Doctor Who series.

Dataset

The dataset includes training and test set images which contain groups of card images. Each card image has a three-digit number ID in the top-left corner which can be used to uniquely
identify a card. Along with the images, two short videos of a selection of cards are also available.

The Tasks
Task-1: Separating out card images from the training set groups of images. 

Task-2: Building Image Matcher

Task-3: Implementing Convolutional Neural network to predict the ID of cards.

Task-4: Locate and identify cards in videos.
